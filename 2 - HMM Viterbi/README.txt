The program can be executed with "python3 exercise_sheet2.py".

Only the accuracy of the model is printed (around 60%). The accuracy would
hopefully be higher with a bigger dataset.

When the delta_1 is 0 for every value the prediction will be a list of empty strings, one for every tag.

To see the values of the prediction it is possible to uncomment the lines in the main function.
